*HTML*
I did not make any changes in the HTML file

*CSS*
#Button1
For this button, I just added a box shadow for when someone hovers over it. I also changed the border's radius when the hovering happens so that it assumes a more round shape. 
#Button2
For this one, I wanted to make the button wider whenever someone clicked on it. I didn't want my transition to be instant, therefore I added a transion time. I also changed the font weight and size so that it is not too tiny as compared to the widening "box".
#Button3
Lastly, I wanted this button to rotate when I hover over it, and also just have background gradient. I added an animation for rotation, and how long it should take. It rotaes 360 degrees, and goes back to where it was before it started rotating as soon as it isn't hovered over anymore. 

*SUBMISSION*
I saved the file with my student number, classcode, group, name + surname and the code for this project, which is SDF05.
